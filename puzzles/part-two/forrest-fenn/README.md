# Forrest Fenn
_Part Two (Chapter XXIV)._

## Hints
- In one of the states: `NM`, `CO`, `WY`, `MT`
- "Recently, some have inquired if one of my boxes I call “The Forrest Fenn Box” is hidden in Yellowstone National Park. This treasure box is not hidden in Yellowstone National Park. This treasure is somewhere in New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, or Montana."
- "If you have read the poem and arrived at the correct search spot, you only need to be thorough, as this search area is not large."
